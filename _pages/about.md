Hello World! Welcome to my cozy cyber nook on the internet!

I am currently a Full-Stack Software Developer Co-op @ [D2L](https://www.d2l.com/) working in the assessments space of [Brigthspace LMS](https://www.d2l.com/brightspace/) as part of Team Mango 🥭.

I ❤️ writing code 🧑‍💻, learning about psychology 🧠, physics ⚛️, and philosophy 💭, traveling to new places ✈️, and playing football ⚽.

I am a Computer Science major @ [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) graduating in May 2024. I am a Tutor for the [BCS Program @ UBC](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/degree-programs/bcs-program-second-degree) and have been a TA for multiple Computer Science courses like [Computer Systems](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=CPSC&course=213), [Software Construction](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=CPSC&course=210) and [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=CPSC&course=221).

I have previously worked as a Software Development Engineer @ [Change Healthcare](https://www.changehealthcare.com/) tasked with the maintenance and enhancement of their [Radiology Imaging](https://www.changehealthcare.com/enterprise-imaging/radiology) solutions.
